## FullStack App  Casino Roulette Game

-Created a full stack application for a Casino Roulette game that allows players to bet money and get a chance to win double what they bet. The wins,  and  losses of the players, and the gains and looses of the casino are being saved in to a database. When admin logs in, they are able to see the games played and the net profit.
